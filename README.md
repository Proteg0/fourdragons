I.	Premise
  A.	The object of this game is to defeat the four dragons located throughout the map.
    1.	In the current build there are no dragons but they will come!
  B.	During your time in this game you will travel (see movement) from location to location fighting different creatures (see combat       and NPCs)
  C.	As you fight you will level(see leveling) gaining more powerful skills(see skills).
  D.	This game is a work in progress, there are sure to be bugs and much room for improvement, however it is hoped that you can enjoy       it for what it is!
  
II.	Menu
  A.	 File Menu
    1.	Save
      a)	Saves the game using the character name. 
      b)	In the current build there is only room for one save per character name, saving again with the same character or another of           the same name will overwrite the save file.
    2.	Load
      a)	When loading, chose the character name you want to load. Typing in this character name will search for a file with that               character name and load you into the starting location however you will retain all the stats/levels of the character you              loaded.
    3.	New Game
      a)	This will quit your current game and start a new one with a character name of your choosing. 
      b)	In the current build you cannot change your mind once you hit new game your current data will be lost, so if you plan on              returning save!
    4.	Quit
      a)	As expected this will quit and close the program.
      b)	This will NOT save your progress, SAVE FIRST!
  B.	Difficulty Menu
    1.	The three difficulty settings here will affect the damage you take from enemies you fight throughout the world. 
      a)	In future updates these settings will be altered slightly to give a better feel for the difference between each setting.

III.	Movement
  A.	You may move in the cardinal directions North, South, East, and West.
  B.	Currently a player may move freely around the map with no obstruction.
    1.	Future updates will cause creatures to have a chance of provoking combat whenever a player tries to leave an occupied area.
  C.	The map is endless, however the creatures generated have a level cap, so progressing beyond those limits will not pose a benefit       to the player.
    1.	Future updates will scale enemies more efficiently allowing for the game to take on a truly endless feel. However be aware            this may come with some fun and challenging surprise enemies that you may not be able to run from!

IV.	Combat
  A.	Combat can be initiated whenever there is an enemy in the zone that you are in.
    1.	If there is an enemy you wish to engage click the attack button on the right side of the screen.
  B.	Whenever combat is initiated, it will not end until the player or their enemy has been defeated. Save often!
  C.	After pressing the attack button you will notice that the bottom movement buttons have been replaced by the combat buttons,           currently you can choose between your four base abilities, more on this in the Graphical User Interface section.

V.	Leveling and Skills
  A.	As you progress through the game you will fight plenty of enemies(see combat). As you do so you will level both your character        and your skills.
  B.	Currently as you use each of your skills they will level.
    1.	In the current build each skill is capped at level two. 
    2.	Future builds will expand upon these skills allowing you to progress much further. 
  C.	The current build does not progress character level.
    1.	The intent which will present itself in future builds is for the player to gain a level each time one of their skills level           presenting a choice as players progress, to use their favorite skills which become harder and harder to level, or go back and         level some of those lower level and weaker skills for the player levels.

VI.	Non-Player Characters (NPCs)
  A.	All current non-player characters are enemies.
    1.	Future NPCs may be beneficial though they will not be implemented until a much later update.
  B.	The current enemies you will see are Wolves, Orcs, Raiders, and Skeletons.
    1.	In a future update each of these types of creatures will be given special abilities including but not limited to abilities            that increase their damage and reduction from damage of certain types.
    2.	Dragons will also make their appearance in a future update, however as it is currently a player would be unable to reach the          level required to defeat a dragon(see Leveling).

VII.	Graphical User Interface
  A.	The top panel of your screen shows your stats and your enemies stats.
    1.	To the left of this panel you will see your name, your current and maximum health and your location. For more on location see         Map.
    2.	If the difficulty is changed(see Menu) you may also see if a difficulty setting other than normal is currently set. This will         appear just below your name.
    3.	The enemies stats will look exactly like your own(minus difficulty setting) and appear only when you are in combat.
  B.	The right panel holds two buttons, Search and Attack.
    1.	The Search button will display some information about the area you are currently in.
      a)	To be included in the future will be interactions with your environment outside of normal movement and combat.
    2.	The Attack button will initiate combat if there is an enemy in the area(see combat).
      a)	More on these buttons in the next section.
  C.	The bottom panel holds four buttons for movement and four buttons for attack.
    1.	Normally you will only see the movement buttons. West , North, South, and East. These will move you one “field” or location in         that direction(See Map).
    2.	When in combat the attack buttons will appear replacing the movement buttons. Each of these buttons represents one of your            four attack types. Clicking a button will use the respective attack on your enemy.
        a)	In future updates these buttons will be renamed with the name of your attack.

VIII.	Map and Fields
  A.	The map is currently not something the user can see outside of their current coordinates.
  B.	The player will always begin the game at the (0,0) location. Each time a player loads they will also be placed at this location.
    1.	Future updates will allow for loading players to load at the location they last saved from.
  C.	As a player progresses away from the center of the map they will notice their location displayed(see Graphical User Interface).
    1.	The further the player is from the center of the map the more difficult the game will become.
  D.	Currently there is nothing stopping a player from running all over the map.
    1.	Updates will limit map exploration(See Movement)
  E.	Future updates will add a more graphical representation of the map.

IX.	Other Coming Updates
  A.	A major update planned is the implementation of weapons and armor.
    1.	Both for the player, and the monsters they will battle.
  B.	More skill types as well as branches within the skill trees will appear forcing players to make a choice as they level.
    1.	There is also thought of “hidden” skills appearing if other skills are leveled in a certain order. Such as losing the ability         to use a two handed weapon if a player has leveled up both magic skills to a certain point before passing another predefined          point with the melee skills. This skill could be replaced with a skill such as a healing skill that would reflect their
        dedication to unlocking the secrets of magic.
